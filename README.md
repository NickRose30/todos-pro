# Todos Pro

Just another todo list application built to practice some new technologies. 

## About

This is a yarn-workspaces monorepo, built to make sharing code between the React-Native application and the regular React web application simple.

The native app is an Expo React-Native project, and the web app is a React app bundled with Parcel.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and cd into the project root
2. Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
3. Run `yarn web` or `yarn native` to start it up
